# Network Investment and Customer Acquisition/Retention Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the relationship between network infrastructure investments and customer acquisition/retention metrics across different geographic areas in Australia. The findings provide insights into how network capacity and distribution correlate with customer acquisition, retention rates, and customer tenure.

## Key Findings

### Geographic Distribution of Network Infrastructure

Our network infrastructure spans 8 states/territories in Australia with varying levels of investment:


| State | Node Count | Total Capacity | Avg Capacity/Node | Customer Count | Retention Rate |
|-------|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| SA | 12 | 48,736 | 4,061.33 | 17 | 88.64% |
| ACT | 10 | 47,779 | 4,777.90 | 17 | 90.62% |
| WA | 6 | 36,623 | 6,103.83 | 7 | 95% |
| QLD | 9 | 33,220 | 3,691.11 | 10 | 78.95% |
| TAS | 9 | 32,812 | 3,645.78 | 9 | 100% |
| VIC | 8 | 31,382 | 3,922.75 | 11 | 92.86% |
| NT | 8 | 30,627 | 3,828.38 | 11 | 89.47% |
| NSW | 7 | 26,885 | 3,840.71 | 8 | 80% |


### Correlation Analysis

The following correlations were observed between network metrics and customer outcomes:

| Metric Pair | Correlation Coefficient |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Total Capacity vs Customer Count | 0.84 |
| Total Capacity vs Retention Rate | 0.18 |
| Total Capacity vs Average Tenure | 0.56 |
| Node Count vs Customer Count | 0.87 |
| Node Count vs Retention Rate | -0.03 |
| Average Capacity per Node vs Retention Rate | 0.32 |

## Interpretation

1. **Network Capacity and Customer Acquisition**: 
   The correlation between total network capacity and customer count indicates how effectively our infrastructure investments are translating into customer acquisition.

2. **Network Quality and Customer Retention**: 
   The correlation between average capacity per node and retention rate shows how network quality (rather than just quantity) affects customer loyalty.

3. **Geographic Investment Efficiency**: 
   Areas with higher capacity per customer may indicate over-investment, while areas with lower capacity per customer might be experiencing network congestion.

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Targeted Infrastructure Investment**:
   - Prioritize investment in areas with high customer acquisition potential but currently low network capacity.
   - Consider scaling back investment in areas with excess capacity relative to customer base.

2. **Retention-Focused Network Upgrades**:
   - In areas with low retention rates but adequate capacity, investigate other factors affecting customer satisfaction.
   - For areas with both low retention and low capacity, prioritize network quality improvements.

3. **Balanced Geographic Expansion**:
   - Develop a balanced approach that considers both population density and potential customer value when planning network expansion.
   - Consider strategic partnerships in areas where building proprietary infrastructure may not be cost-effective.

4. **Customer Segmentation Strategy**:
   - Align network investments with high-value customer segments in each geographic area.
   - Develop targeted offerings based on the network usage patterns in different regions.

## Next Steps

1. Conduct a deeper analysis of network performance metrics (latency, reliability) in relation to customer satisfaction.
2. Develop a predictive model to forecast the ROI of planned network investments.
3. Create a dashboard to monitor the ongoing relationship between network metrics and customer outcomes.
